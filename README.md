# Unix-
# Task #1.

Write a script renaming files by inserting a suffix to the file name before the file's extension. For example, if the suffix is "sfx", the renaming should be done in the following way:Â 

	
	"a" -> "asfx"



	"a.txt" -> "asfx.txt"



	"abc.doc" -> "abcsfx.doc"



	"abc.txt.doc" -> "abc.txtsfx.doc"
	

, etc. The suffix is the first script argument followed by the renamed file list. Syntax:


	`./insert_suffix [-d] [-v] [-h] [--] sfx files...`

The script should support the following options (keys):


	
	 -h print help message (usage, command syntax, supported options, and arguments)

	 -d "dry run", print old and new file names without actual renaming

	 -v print old and new names of renamed files (without the options script act silently)

	 -- option and suffix/file names separator
	


Take into account that filenames and the suffix may contain shell metacharacters including wildcards and start with a minus sign char (-).


Execution examples:


	
	./insert_suffix -d sfx file*.txt



	(add sfx as a suffix to all files in current directory with .txt extension, dry run)


	./insert_suffix -v sfx -- *



	(add sfx as a suffix to all files in the current directory, verbose run, make sure that files started with - are also renamed correctly)


	./insert_suffix -- -v *
	

(add -v as a suffix to all files in the current directory, silent run, make sure that files started with - are also renamed correctly) and so on.

The script should correctly handle argument and option syntax errors (absence of the suffix or filenames, incorrect options, etc, printing a corresponding error message to the error stream and stopping execution with non-zero status).

Additionally, you may

-check for renaming errors (e.g. file not found, no permission, and so on, maybe done in the most reliable way by checking "mv" exit status, also pre-check by test/[/[[ command to find the actual reason is also possible);
	
-add an option to change the default in case of files with "double" (or more) extensions (what to treat as an extension, the part of the name of the file after last or after the first occurrence of the dot (period) character?
	
-add an option for interactive mode (i.e. confirm each file renaming, ask in what place to put suffix);
	
-handle a situation when a file without extension is given by a relative or absolute path and some path's directory names do contain an extension (without handling it separately, the script would fail in this case)
	
and other improvements.

## To use this code, you need to save it to a file and make it executable. Here are the steps to do that:

Open a text editor and copy the code into a new file.

	Save the file as `insert_suffix.sh`.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Run the following command to make the script executable:

	`chmod +x insert_suffix.sh`

To insert a suffix to the file name before the file's extension, run the following command:

	`./insert_suffix.sh [-d] [-v] [-h] [--] suffix files...`

Here is an explanation of the command and its arguments:

./insert_suffix.sh: This is the name of the script that you want to run.
[-d]: This is an optional argument that specifies the dry run option. If this option is set, the script will print the old and new file names without actually renaming the files.
[-v]: This is an optional argument that specifies the verbose option. If this option is set, the script will print the old and new names of renamed files.
[-h]: This is an optional argument that specifies the help option. If this option is set, the script will print a help message and exit.
[--]: This is an optional argument that is used as a separator between the suffix and the file list.
suffix: This is the suffix that you want to insert into the file names.
files...: This is the list of files that you want to rename.
Here are some examples of how to use the script:

To add "sfx" as a suffix to all files in the current directory with the .txt extension, run the following command in dry run mode:

	`./insert_suffix.sh -d sfx file*.txt`

To add "sfx" as a suffix to all files in the current directory, run the following command in verbose mode:

	`./insert_suffix.sh -v sfx -- *`

To add "-v" as a suffix to all files in the current directory, run the following command in silent mode:

	`./insert_suffix.sh -- -v *`

For more information about the script's options and usage, run the script with the "-h" option:

	`./insert_suffix.sh -h`

### Note: The script will exit with a non-zero status if there are any errors, such as invalid arguments or missing files. It will also print error messages to the error stream to help you troubleshoot the problem.
